## Description of the audio fix

Zoom SDK use the native library for fetching microphones as builtin, microphone in earphones or bluetooth devices. As for Android TVs doesn't have this types of microphone and use usb-camera. So when user need audio, we off speakerphones and it allows TV record and share audio from microphone in usb-camera.

```java
 setVolumeControlStream(AudioManager.STREAM_VOICE_CALL);
 am = (AudioManager) getSystemService(Context.AUDIO_SERVICE);
 am.setSpeakerphoneOn(false);
```
This code you can find in MyMeetingActivity.java file in 756-758 lines.
